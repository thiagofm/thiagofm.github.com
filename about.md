title: About me 
---

I'm a software engineer with codes [here](https://github.com/thiagofm) and [CV](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thiago-fernandes-massa/51/91a/248).

I really enjoy programming languages in general: from R to Ruby. I'm currently interested in becoming a data scientist.

Outside of programming, I'm a nerdish/geekish type of guy. I really like economics, some politics and video games.
