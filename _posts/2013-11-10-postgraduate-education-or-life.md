So it has been a while. Just giving a small update:
* I quit my 500 days of open source thing for greater good(left my
parents home and started living 100% alone).
* Started working for r7.com. For now it gave me the opportunity to
deploy to production a real-time application made with
node.js+socket.io. Been enjoying so far!
* Released memcached-manager, just need to work on its frontend and
artwork.
* Currently refactoring minimagick and watching carrierwave issues a little
more.

Now back on the title, I'm currently in the need to make a important
decision: what I'm going to do the next 2 years with my life. Two options:

1. Try to move abroad:

Involves studying the next year to get a very good score in IELTS, TOEIC and TOEFL(the order matters). IELTS is the exam used to move to Canada. Canada is awesome, but I have US in my heart. But the getting the US work permit(H1B or O1) is hard and relies in a lot of stuff that are out of my control. Everybody that I know that left my country to the US were way older or in a way better financial position than I am(actually, their parents's financial position).

Study french. French is very helpful to get the Canada work visa as it's a more of 'sure thing'. Once you have a good score for the visa(and english + a degree) it seems that everything that lies ahead is a lot of bureocracy and of course, entering the plane.

Keep writing OSS. This is something I love to do, it's my hobby and something that I have a lot of passion for. I'm progressively getting better with maintaining projects and with code itself. Next year is surely going to be my best year so far with it.

Also, it's a gamble. It's not a sure thing and study all that french is expensive. But it's one in a lifetime chance: I'm in a time in my life that I have basically nothing that would keep me here in Brazil. If I fail... I will have done what I liked and learned a new language(french) and mastered better another(english).

2. Postgraduate education

It's going to take about the investment that I'm going to do in languages. It's going to give me a piece of paper in exchange of money and hours spent.

Brazil has a bubble with postgraduation where most of people who are
taking a MBA has never been in charge of a team. I don't really like to
take the options of others as a rule, but everyone who I talked with
about it(people who did finish it) told me that it's just a piece of
paper and some entertainment/wasted hours.

But... its a piece of paper that could get me a raise which I don't
desperately need. Money is good, but it's not going to make my life much
better than it is. It's safe. I'm a human and I like to feel the safety
that it does bring.

I hope I don't regret taking #1 later.
