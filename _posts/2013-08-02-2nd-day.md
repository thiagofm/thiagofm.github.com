So, just giving a update on my second day of my 500 days journey. Today
was about the stats part of
[memcached-manager](http://github.com/thiagofm/memcached-manager). Maybe
I will try to find somebody on dribble willing to improve their
portifolio. This is one of the times I wish I knew more people.

It still needs a lot of love for the design part(It could use some
graphs like the [amnesia](https://github.com/benschwarz/amnesia) gem).

This is a big milestone as it's time I get the artwork going. It will be
a small play of the memcached logo with the sinatra hat. I did some
drafts a while ago:

I don't have much experience with illustrator so it might take me a
while to get the vector out of it, but I will.

That's all folks.
