Hello,

I'm currently in a mission to do a 500 days steak of OSS. For
those who don't know, I currently left my job as Lead Engineer of
Payleven(in Brazil). The reason?

I found out that I _really_ want to improve my technical side more, I 
want to be the best software engineer that I could ever be. This
is my line for now. I was doing a lot of management stuff and saw that
I'm young enough to still work with lots of hands on code.

One of the ways that I've thought is just... writing code, fixing stuff
and Github is there to help me.

So, for now as I'm free until I find my next awesome job I'll do my best
to finish up my project called
[memcached-manager](http://github.com/thiagofm/memcached-manager) and keep maintaining
[carrierwave](http://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) and
[minimagick](http://github.com/minimagick/minimagick). I have plans for both as it needs some fixes
and features that I've been postponing for a while. I plan to contribute
with other projects so if you read this post and need some help, contact
me, please!

Other stuff that will help me to become a better hacker and I want to
have the discipline to do:

- Study: currently into functional programming. I have to finish up
reading the 'Learn you some erlang' book and begin with the 'The Joy of
Clojure'. I will try to review them here.
- Practice typing: I want to get up to 100 average wpm on typeracer.
Some people tell me that programming is about reading code and thinking
-- I think they are right, but you'll spend some of your time typing, It
isn't much but I think it's worth at least learning to touch type
well(and type @ around 70wpm). This 100wpm thing is a hobby thing, ok?
- Healthy lifestyle: I started working out a little more than 1 year ago
and so far I've learned a little about dieting well, got a little better
heart and I just feel better the whole day overall.

So far, so good. Now let's get down with the work. I will try to post
here updates as writing is a good way to compromise with something.
